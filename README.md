# Symbols - A programming language created by Talha Ahmad (c)
A programming language was created in Python to store messages in a fully encrypted way that only my compiler could translate.

## USEFUL INFORMATION

1. A stack contains 8 cells which is fixed.
2. A cell contains 0 as the default value.
3. By default there is 1 stack in memory.
4. By default cell pointer is 0.
5. A group of stacks is called memory, with a maximum of 16 stacks in memory.

## OPERATORS

### Increment

'+' is used to increment the value in the current stack's cell by 1

### Decrement

'-' is used to decrement the value in the current stack's cell by 1

### Double

'*' is used to double the value in the current stack's cell

### Half

/ is used to half the value in the current stack's cell

### Bitwise AND

& is used to perform bitwise AND on the value in the current stack's cell with the value in the right side stack's cell

### Bitwise OR

| is used to perform bitwise OR on the value in the current stack's cell with the value in the right side stack's cell

### Bitwise NOT

~ is used to perform bitwise NOT on the value in the current stack's cell with the value in the right side stack's cell

### Bitwise XOR

^ is used to perform bitwise XOR on the value in current stack's cell with the value in the right side stack's cell

## NAVIGATION

### Next cell

'>' is used to go to the next cell in the current stack

### Previous cell

< is used to go to the previous cell in the current stack

### First cell

( is used to go to the first cell in the current stack

### Last cell

) is used to go to the last cell in the current stack

### Next stack

} is used to go to the next stack

### Previous stack

{ is used to go to the previous stack

### First stack

[ is used to go to the first stack

### Last stack

] is used to go to the last stack

## ADVANCE

### Output

@ is used to display ASCII value at the current stack's cell

### Add Stack

_ is used to add a new stack at the last of memory

### Reset Stack

! is used to reset the current stack in memory

### Program Termination

. is used to terminate the current program
